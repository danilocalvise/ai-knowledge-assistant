# AI Knowledge Assistant Test Document

## Introduction

This is a test document for the AI Knowledge Assistant backend. It contains multiple sections to test the chunking and metadata extraction capabilities.

## Features

The enhanced backend includes:

- File upload and processing
- Automatic format detection
- Metadata extraction
- Intelligent chunking with overlap
- Structure preservation

## Technical Details

### File Processing
The system can handle various document formats:
1. **PDF files** - Requires PyMuPDF
2. **DOCX files** - Uses python-docx
3. **Markdown files** - Native support
4. **Text files** - Basic text processing

### Chunking Strategy
The chunking service implements:
- Token-aware splitting using tiktoken
- Configurable chunk size (default: 1000 tokens)
- Overlap between chunks (default: 200 tokens)
- Structure preservation for sections

## Conclusion

This document serves as a test case for the enhanced backend functionality. Each section should be processed separately while maintaining the document structure and metadata.
